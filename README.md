# Profiles

These are just pages for my profile, you'll find all of them on the main domain hehe. Basically a list of everything you need to know about me and everything I'm working on. This doesn't have any dev branch, since it doesn't really need it -> Uploads are automated using GitHub's webhooks, I do create branches for adding content or changing styles as needed though :3
